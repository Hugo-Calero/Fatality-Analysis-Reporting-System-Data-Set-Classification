# Fatality-Analysis-Reporting-System-Data-Set-Classification

The goal here is to predict the severity level of car (9 different levels) accidents using machine learning techniques. Given the dimensionality of the data set and the 
severe imbalance in the target feature, an array of different imbalance correction and feature selection techniques have been evaluated. Several different machine learning 
algorithms have been used in this work.
